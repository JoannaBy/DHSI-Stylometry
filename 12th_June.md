## Cool links to check out
### For playing with corpus
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - tool good for changing formatting, allows for editing multiple files at the same time.  
* [GrepWin](https://tools.stefankueng.com/grepWin.html) - searching and replacing in multiple files at the same time.
### Part-of-speech tagging tools
* [Treetagger](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/) - one of the easiest to use
* [Stanford tagger](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.html) - more difficult to use, but also one of the best tools there are. 
### Regular expressions aka regex
* [Get regex skills doing crosswords!](https://regexcrossword.com/) - by far the coolest way to learn regex.  
* [Regex sandbox](https://regex101.com/) - this is where you can test your regex.  
* You can also join tomorrow's classes "Regular Expressions in 60 Minutes" in MacLaurin D107 [more info](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZzti2j-_zAbaGnepYBDgYPLqADp1dYmqo1fFJ5CCrU/edit)
