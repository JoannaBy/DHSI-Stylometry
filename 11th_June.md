## What we've covered so far?
Today we learnt...

### Stylometry:
By now you should be familiar with:
* most frequent words and why they matter,
* the concept of Delta distance measure,
* cluster analysis method
* bootstrap consensus tree (more on that tomorrow!)

### The reading behind that (three first texts in your coursepack):
* Rybicki, J., Eder, M., Hoover, D. L. "Computational Stylistics and Text Analysis."
in Doing Digital Humanities. Practice, Training, Research. Eds Crompton, C.,
Lane, R.J., Siemens, R. Oxford: Routledge, 2016, pp. 123-144.
* Jockers, M. L. “Part I: Foundation.” in Macroanalysis. Digital Methods and Literary
History., University of Illinois Press, 2013, pp. 1-32.
* Hoover, D. L. “Quantitative Analysis and Literary Studies.” A Companion to Digital
Literary Studies, edited by Ray Siemens and Susan Schreibman, Blackwell, 2008
(text from online version).

While this is more advanced than the presentation Jan sent you, you can take a look at general Stylo in a nutshell presentation. We'll be covering issues discussed in it for the next two days.
