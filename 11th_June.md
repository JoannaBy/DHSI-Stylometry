## What we've covered so far?

### Introduction to stylometry:
By now you should be familiar with:
* most frequent words and why they matter,
* the concept of Delta distance measure,
* cluster analysis - simple classification supervised machine learning method,
* bootstrap consensus tree (more on that tomorrow!)

### The reading behind that (the three first texts are in your coursepack):
* Rybicki, J., Eder, M., Hoover, D. L. "Computational Stylistics and Text Analysis." in Doing Digital Humanities. Practice, Training, Research. Eds Crompton, C., Lane, R.J., Siemens, R. Oxford: Routledge, 2016, pp. 123-144.
* Jockers, M. L. “Part I: Foundation.” in Macroanalysis. Digital Methods and Literary History., University of Illinois Press, 2013, pp. 1-32.
* Hoover, D. L. “Quantitative Analysis and Literary Studies.” A Companion to Digital Literary Studies, edited by Ray Siemens and Susan Schreibman, Blackwell, 2008 (text from online version). 
* Burrows, J. F. Computation into Criticism: A Study of Jane Austen’s Novels and Experiment in Method. Clarendon Press, 1987. *You can find it in UVic's library!*

## Cool links to check out:
[Stylo on Github](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo) - a must-know link - this is where everything related to *stylo* happens.
While this is more advanced than the presentation Jan sent you, you can take a look at a more general [Stylo in a nutshell](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/stylo_nutshell/) presentation. We'll be covering issues discussed in it for the next two days.
