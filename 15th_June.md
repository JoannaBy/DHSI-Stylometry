## What have we covered today?
### Introduction to stylometry
* Modularity algorithm
  * Is one of *community detection* algorithms.
  * Modularity has a high value when many more edges in a network fall between vertices of the same type then one would expect by chance,
  * Good divisions of the network into communities are those that have high values of the corresponding modularity.

* Community detection:
  * the search for the naturally occurring groups in a network regardless of their number or size,
  * used primarily as a tool for discovering and understanding the large-scale structure of networks.
  * separates network into groups of vertices that have few connections between them.
* Writing simple R scripts

## Extra reading
* Learn more about SVM as implemented in stylo [doc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/e1071.pdf)

## Cool links to check out:
* [UDPipe tool](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/) - syntax analysis and processing tool Jan told you about.

## What's next?
* Read more papers by members of Computational Stylistics Group [old website](https://sites.google.com/site/computationalstylistics/papers-and-articles) and other scholars related to [Federation of Stylometry Labs](http://fosl.ijp.pan.pl/)
* What journals to watch?
  * [Digital Scholarship in Humanities](https://academic.oup.com/dsh)
  * [Journal of Cultural Analytics](http://culturalanalytics.org/about/)
* Perhaps get interested in:
  * topic modeling? 
  e.g. [Topic modeling and genres in lit](https://dragonfly.hypotheses.org/530)
  * distributional semantics aka word embeddings?
  e.g. [Diachronical changes of meanings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/histwords/)
